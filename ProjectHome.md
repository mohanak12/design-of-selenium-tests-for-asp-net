Sample application to show how to use test patterns in testing ASP NET applications using Selenium.


Archived goals:
  * Make UI tests easy to maintain.
  * Make UI tests easy to read and implement.
  * Demonstrate some aspects of testing AJAX applications.
  * Handling problems with persistence.
  * Meaningful error descriptions if tests were failed.
  * Code generation
  * Make possible to create UI acceptance tests for non-programmers using DSL.
  * Decreasing testing time with Selenium GRID.
  * Make UI tests running on continuous integration build.

The goals to archive:
  * Perform performance testing using acceptance testing codebase.
